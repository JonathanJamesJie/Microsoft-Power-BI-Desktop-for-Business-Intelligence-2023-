Project for Maven Analytics - Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence (2023) Course on Udemy

I found that Maven Analytics Udemy Course Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence (2023) gave me the basics to start on my Power Bi Learning.

The course covered key aspects of using Power Bi and with the many follow along tutorials made learning was easier for me. The Maven Markets project gave me a taste of creating dashboards from scratch and was a good starting experience.

The project has data from Maven Market, a multi-national grocery chain with locations in Canada, Mexico and the United States.

Working through the entire business intelligence workflow: connecting and shaping the data, building a relational model, adding calculated fields, and designing an interactive report.

For myself, creating dashboards isn't about making it look nice but presenting data in a clear and precise way where key stakeholders can make use of these insights to create and take actions that effect businesses.
